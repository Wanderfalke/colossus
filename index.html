      <p>
      Colossus is a lightweight framework for building high-performance network
      I/O applications in Scala.  In particular Colossus is focused on
      low-latency <em>microservices</em>, single-feature stateless applications
      with a RESTful API.  Colossus aims to maximize performance while keeping
      the interface clean and concise.

      <h2> Built at Tumblr</h2>
      <p>
        Colossus was built to address many of the challenges we've faced at
        Tumblr when writing Scala services.  It has greatly simplified the
        development process, allowing engineers to rapidly build services that
        are production-ready with minimal effort.  Colossus is currently used
        in several production systems throughout Tumblr's infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>We need your help!.</strong>  Colossus is still in the early
        stages of development and while we've met many of the goals we set out
        to achieve, there's still much to be done.  Features need to be
        implemented, bugs needs to be fixed, optimizations need to be
        optimized.  If you find a bug or have a cool idea, let us know and get
        involved!
